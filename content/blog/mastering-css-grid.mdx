CSS Grid is a powerful layout system available in CSS. It allows you to create complex, responsive web layouts with ease.

## Understanding Grid Containers and Items

A grid layout consists of a grid container and several grid items. The grid container must have its `display` property set to `grid` or `inline-grid`.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
}
```

All direct children of this container will automatically become grid items.

## Grid Columns

You can specify how many columns you wish to create using the `grid-template-columns` property. The property accepts any number of values. The number of values determines the number of columns, and the value itself determines the size of that column.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px;
}

.item {
  font-family: Georgia, "Times New Roman", Times, serif;
  font-size: x-large;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 1px solid orange;
  background-color: bisque;
}
```

## Responsive Grids

CSS Grid makes it easy to create responsive layouts using `fr` units and media queries.

## Conclusion

With CSS Grid, you can build layouts that were previously difficult or impossible with floats or flexbox alone.
