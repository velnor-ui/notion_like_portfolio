GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need, and nothing more.

## Benefits Over REST

Unlike REST APIs, GraphQL APIs allow clients to request exactly the data they need, avoiding over-fetching and under-fetching problems common with REST endpoints.

## Setting Up a Basic GraphQL Server

Setting up a GraphQL server is straightforward with libraries like Apollo Server or Express GraphQL. You define a schema that specifies the types of data available and the queries clients can make.

## Conclusion

GraphQL can greatly improve the flexibility and efficiency of your API development.
