Next.js 14 is the latest version of the React framework that enables you to build full-stack web applications. In this guide, we'll explore the key features and improvements that make Next.js 14 a powerful choice for modern web development.

## Key Features

### Server Components

Server Components are a revolutionary feature that allows you to write UI that can be rendered and cached on the server. This leads to:

- Reduced client-side JavaScript
- Improved initial page load
- Better SEO
- Automatic code splitting

### App Router

The new App Router provides a more intuitive way to organize your application's routing structure:

```typescript
app/
  ├── page.tsx
  ├── layout.tsx
  ├── blog/
  │   ├── page.tsx
  │   └── [slug]/
  │       └── page.tsx
  └── about/
      └── page.tsx
```

### Server Actions

Server Actions allow you to run asynchronous code directly on the server:

```typescript
"use server";

async function submitForm(formData: FormData) {
  const name = formData.get("name");
  // Process the form data
}
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js 14 project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 brings significant improvements to the developer experience and application performance. Whether you're building a small blog or a large-scale application, Next.js 14 provides the tools and features you need to succeed.
